This is a simple demonstration of how to use SDL to create an application that generates sound, in particular a sinusoidal tone. you can play around with the frequency, volume, as well as the function used for the tone generation.
Can you generate a [square wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave) or a [sawtooth wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave)?

Compile and link with SDL, e.g.:
```
g++ -Wall -O3 -o main -lSDL2 main.cpp
```
